## Preface
WolfBot is a JDA Discord Bot. It's one of my first bigger projects I've ever coded and "finished" (I will still work on it).
Don't be too serious, I know not everything makes much sense, and the code is not the best and can be optimized in many points,
but the solutions I found and used were the best working for me. I learned and had a lot of fun and added some features only for learning 
purpose.
